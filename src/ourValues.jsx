            <p>At GISC we provide each student with a holistic, inquiry-based, and engaging curriculum. We prepare each student to be an internationally minded citizen who takes action to contribute positively to their community and the world. Our academic curriculum, environmental provision and operational practices are deeply rooted in GEMSâ€™ four Core Values; Always Learning, Care, Excellence and One Team. Through our values students become confident, tolerant, resilient people of integrity, capable of both leadership and compassion.</p>
