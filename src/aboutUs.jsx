        <h3>GEMS International School Cairo</h3>
        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>
        Under the renowned GEMS international network, we opened the doors of our purpose-built, high tech, environmentally conscious school located in New Cairo, Rehab 2 in September 2022.<br/><br/>

We initially opened our early years, primary and middle schools in 2022, adding upper grades in subsequent years with a projected enrollment of 1400 students. Our school is notable for its emphasis on inclusion and diversity, future thinking technology skills, and most importantly, developing impactful global citizens with a mission to serve our world: Inspiring Leaders, Future Thinkers, Fearless Explorers, Diversity Ambassadors.
