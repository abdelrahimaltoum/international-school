                <p>
                GISC is now an Authorized School for the PYP, MYP, and a Candidate School* for the DP Programme. GISC is pursuing authorization as an IB World School. These are schools that share a common philosophyâ€”a commitment to high quality, challenging, international education that GISC believes is important for our students. <br/> <br/> 

*Only schools authorized by the IB Organization can offer any of its four academic programmes: the Primary Years Programme (PYP), the Middle Years Programme (MYP), the Diploma Programme, or the Career-related Programme (CP). Candidate status gives no guarantee that authorization will be granted. For further information about the IB and its programmes, visit www.ibo.org
