                <span>Welcome to the future. Welcome to GISC!</span>
                <p>GISC always makes sure our young geniuses receive nothing but the best, academically and pastorally. </p>
                <p>GISC-ians have the opportunity to develop all their skills and a sophisticated sensory perception with our technology-infused environment. Collaboration on various projects with peers will build confidence and nurture problem-solving skills. Researching the many dimensions of a problem will become second nature next to their critical thinking talents. </p>
