            <span>At GEMS International School Cairo, the future is NOW!</span>
            <p>From Pre-K through Grade 11 and beyond, our students are experiencing real-world technology every single day in their classrooms and throughout our school campus. Imagine being greeted by our GISC student-programmed WOW robots as you enter the front doors!</p>
            <p>With 4 Innovation Labs, including a Maker Space for our youngest students, LEGO Robotics, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, simulators, hands-on design tools, high-tech communications, video and broadcasting equipment. There is nothing our students cannot accomplish with the latest in technology hardware and applications.  Letâ€™s get started!</p>

            <p>From Pre-K through Grade 1, our classrooms are equipped with class sets of iPads for daily student use.  From Grades 2 through 5, we ask that each student bring their own iPad to maximize their learning.  For Grade 6 and on, students are requested to bring their own MacBooks (Air is sufficient) to reflect the increased sophistication of the secondary learning environment. Our teachers all have MacBook Air laptops, and each classroom space have the latest Promethean interactive panel.  All GISC teachers are Apple Certified Teachers from the very first year! </p>
